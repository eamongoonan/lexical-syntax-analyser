CCAL Compiler Frontend â€“ Lexer & Parser in ANTLR4
This project implements the frontend of a compiler for a simple custom language called CCAL. Built using ANTLR4, it features both a lexical analyzer (scanner) and syntax analyzer (parser).
The project demonstrates compiler design fundamentals, including grammar definition, tokenization, and parsing tree generation.
